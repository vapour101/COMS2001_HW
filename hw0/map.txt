Important segments:
    .text:  contains code
    .data:  contains pre-allocated static variables
    .bss:   contains unallocated static variables
    
The stack is growing up (towards 000...)

The stack frame for each recursive call is 0x30.

The heap is at 0xA20010 (above the stack), growing down (towards FFF...)

No, there is a gap of 12 (0xC) between the two malloc-ed sections of memory.
